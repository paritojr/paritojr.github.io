      <h1>Father's Week news!</h1>
      <p>Hello there! I've got some... updates to you</p>
      <p>(and whoever who is watching this...), the first one:</p>
      <h1>̶x̶d̶o̶g̶ Dogers development</h1>
      <p>So... recently you may be (somehow) excited for ̶x̶d̶o̶g̶ Dogers.</p>
      <p>A few changes are made:</p>
      <p>-The OS isn't going to be xdog, it's going to be called Dogers</p>
      <p>-Originally there was going to be an "This is not Windows" error if you</p>
      <p>pressed CTRL+ALT+DEL but i'm going to discard that... i mean, where's the</p>
      <p>fun part?</p>
      <p>Maybe there's just 2 major changes lol.</p>
      <p>btw this doesn't mean that its still in development</p>
      <p>the past post i said that when i would finished Dogers i would</p>
      <p>make a post in the newsletters.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>well i dont promises so dont expect this is actually true XD</p>
      <h1>DAILY FUN FACT</h1>
      <p>the name of Dogers has "Doge" in it cuz "Doge"rs</p>
      <h1>FINISH</h1>
      <p>so...</p>
