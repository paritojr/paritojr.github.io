      <h1>Welcome to the newsletter!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the newsletter! Here i can share some news with you</p>
      <p>(and whoever who is watching this...), currently there's only 2 things</p>
      <p>to tell:</p>
      <li>Happy Mother's Day!</li>
      <li>and walkaway.</li>
      <h1>walkaway.</h1>
      <p>I recently started to have an idea of an videogame...</p>
      <p>Because i'm a big FAN of RPG's, i decided to do this.</p>
      <p>So... i actually did some things like concept art and more...</p>
      <p>(there isn't actually more things than the concept art)</p>
      <p>I decided to do it on<a href="https://github.com/electron/electron">Electron</a> (it's way more easier</p>
      <p>after all, i know html, css and js for now)</p>
      <h1>DAILY FUN FACT</h1>
      <p>Did you know that walkaway was originally to be called RUNAWAY. Yeah...</p>
      <p>There was a game named that way, so i had to change it to walkaway (i didn't have any other</p>
      <p>other name idea on my mind lol).</p>
      <h1>FINISH</h1>
      <p>I'll take a break today... after all...</p>
      <p>And i hope you have a good Mother's Day!</p>
