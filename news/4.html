      <h1>28/06/24:</h1>
      <h1>Awesome news!</h1>
      <p>Hello there! I've got some incredible (and unbelievable)</p>
      <p>updates to you (and whoever who is watching this). The first one:</p>
      <h1>Dogers development</h1>
      <p>So... lemme tell you some good news, and bad news:</p>
      <p>Good news:</p>
      <p>The main programs (such as the AI and DAS(Dogers Animation Studio)) are</p>
      <p>going to get on Windows and Mac (if you wonder why you'll see it soon)</p>
      <p>Bad news:</p>
      <p>Dogers is cancelled.</p>
      <p>but don't be sad (because it was going to be just a normal OS</p>
      <p>what did you even expected, though, it was only to have 2 programs</p>
      <p>that weren't added in any OS)</p>
      <p>so btw, you'll probably like this:</p>
      <h1>Doger AI</h1>
      <p>I found a way to make an AI without even needing a library (just in JavaScript and HTML)</p>
      <p>And guess what? Today it's getting released (as a beta, don't expect it to be perfect)!</p>
      <p>So i'm starting right now (after this post)!</p>
      <p>hey...</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>i bet you'll like it.</p>
      <h1>DAILY FUN FACT</h1>
      <p>i like cheese.</p>
      <h1>FINISH</h1>
      <p>Some big changes, huh? And i believed you</p>
      <p>wouldn't be even surprised! Anyway,</p>
      <p>i hope you have a good day (wow, this month passed too fast)</p>
      <p>and you're great and all... so</p>
      <p>See ya!</p>
